# Image to ASCII converter

## How to use?

For great work with image you can change `WIDTH_OFFSET` and `MAX_WIDTH` const

The program saves an ASCII picture to an `out.txt` file.

`out.txt` file is located in the same directory as the exe file of the program.

## Input image
![Input image](/images/in1.jpg)

## Out
![Output image](/images/out1.jpg)

## Input image
![Input image](/images/in2.jpg)

## Out text from `out.txt` file

![Output text](/images/out2.jpg)
